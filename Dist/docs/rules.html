<a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Olympia is an open-ended computer moderated fantasy simulation. 
&nbsp;Characters move, battle, explore and study in the Olympian world. 
Each 
week, players submit orders for their units. After the turn runs, 
Olympia sends 
reports to the players detailing what happened.</P>
<P>Olympia is set in a low technology fantasy world. Characters do not 
have 
fixed goals. They may study whatever skills they believe will be useful 
and 
pursue goals as they find them. Olympia has no victory conditions; no 
winner is 
ever declared.</P>
<P>An aspiring heroic fighter may purchase weapons, study combat and 
slay 
monsters. Business-minded individuals can establish a profitable trading 
empire. 
The study of magic could furnish tools to advance dark plans. An 
explorer could 
trade his gold to a shipbuilder for a galley, and set out on the high 
seas to 
find adventure and treasure.</P>
<P>Olympia turn reports tend to be long, detailed and dense. Since your 
player 
character may hire other units which can study, move and fight on their 
own, 
large factions of characters may be organized. Supplying orders for many 
units 
in a large faction can be a lot of work!</P>
<P>A turn report for a new player controlling three characters is about 
five (66 
line) pages. Average turn reports tend to be 15-25 pages. The size of 
the report 
will depend on whether a player chooses to concentrate development in a 
few 
characters, or to pursue an empire- building strategy of acquiring many 
units 
and controlling as much territory as possible.</P>
</div>

<ul>
<li id="overview">
<a href="#overview">Overview</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Each player begins with control of one character and a sum of gold, 
the 
Olympian currency. Characters may hire subordinates, study skills, trade 
items, 
build things, and explore. Each turn a player submits orders for all of 
the 
characters they control. These include the initial character, known as 
the 
Player Character, and any vassals of the player character, which belong 
to the 
player's faction.</P>
<P>The Olympia program will execute orders for characters in parallel. 
Each 
order may take no time or some number of game days to complete. As many 
orders 
will be processed for each character as game time allows. Orders not 
completed 
by the end of the turn may continue into the next. Each turn covers one 
month of 
game time. An Olympian month lasts 30 game days.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</div>
</li>

<li id="schedule">
<a href="#schedule">Turn schedule</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Turns are run on Mondays, at 12:00 noon,
Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)
or Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT),
depending on whether daylight savings is in effect in Sydney, Australia.</P>
<P>Players should receive their turn reports as soon as email can be delivered. 
Late 
orders will queue for the next turn. Beware! Even if mailed before the 
deadline, 
your message may take some time to get to the order scanner. Send your 
orders in 
early to avoid grief. This will also give you time to correct 
mistakes 
reported by the order scanner.</P>
<P>New player additions are performed when the turn is run.</P>
<P>If for technical reasons the turn cannot be run at the scheduled time,
it will be run as 
soon as the technical issues have been dealt with. &nbsp;If a long delay 
is 
expected, players will be notified by email.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</div>
</li>

<li id="olympia_times">
<a href="#olympia_times">Olympia Times</a>
<div class="details">
<P>The Olympia Times is published with each turn and mailed to each player 
in the 
game. The Times has three sections: any comments or notices from the GM 
(if 
there are any), signed press, and rumors.</P>
<P>Players should submit items to the Times with the press and rumor 
commands.</P>
</div>
</li>

<li id="email_forwarding">
<a href="#email_forwarding">Diplomatic email forwarding service</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Players can send mail to the player controlling an entity by mailing 
to <A 
href="mailto:olympia@shadowlandgames.com">olympia@shadowlandgames.com</A>.</P>
<P>For example, suppose you saw the following characters:</P>
<P>Seen here:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Circe [2225], with three peasants, 
accompanied 
by:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hephaestus [3446], with 11 peasants</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Circe's lord isn't identified, so you don't know what player is 
controlling 
her. However, it is still possible to send Circe's owner a message. Mail 
to <A 
href="mailto:olympia@shadowlandgames.com">olympia@shadowlandgames.com</A> and 
include the 
following:</P>
<P>#forwardto: 2225<BR>Welcome to my lands! Prepare to die!</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>The message will be forwarded to whatever player is controlling Circe 

[2225].</P>
<P>Forwarding works for character and player entities. Mail sent to 
other entity 
numbers, or to unaffiliated characters, will be silently discarded.</P>
<P>Forwarded mail is not anonymous. The original headers on your message 
will be 
preserved.</P>
</div>
</li>

<li id="error_compensation">
<a href="#error_compensation">Compensation for errors</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Bugs are inevitable in large, complex programs such as the Olympia 
game 
engine. While every effort is made to ferret out bugs, players must 
expect that 
from time to time something will go wrong.</P>
<P>If you cannot tolerate encountering bugs, please do not play 
Olympia.</P>
<P>There are usually more bugs at the start of a game than after it has 
been 
running for a while.</P>
<P>Because of the nature of how Olympia processes turns, it is not 
possible to 
re-run a turn for a single player if something goes wrong. Turns may 
only be 
re-run for all players. Therefore, re-runs will be considered for only 
the most 
serious bug-provoked disasters which affect many players.</P>
<P>Generally the preferred compensation for being the victim of a bug is 
some 
grant of CLAIM gold or other items. It is difficult and error-prone to 
attempt 
to move items around the game database, and there are fairness issues 
for other 
players who may be unpleasantly surprised by database edits occuring 
between 
turns.</P>
<P>All compensation given for bugs is solely at the discretion of the 
GM. 
Effects for minor bugs are assumed to even out across most players over 
the 
course of the game, so compensation is usually granted only for bugs 
which have 
seriously impacted a player.</P>
<P>Please concisely document any bugs you find, providing short excerpts 
from 
turn reports to show what went wrong.</P>
<P>If you feel you require compensation, briefly state how your position 
was 
irrevokably harmed by the bug, and suggest a suitable compensation 
(preferably 
in the form of CLAIM items which may be provided).</P>
<P>Bug reports should be posted on the forum or emailed to <A 
href="mailto:admin@shadowlandgames.com">admin@shadowlandgames.com</A>.

<div class="details">
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">1. A player may not control more than one 
faction 
in the game. Also, multiple players from the same account are not 
allowed. Each 
player must have their own unique email address. &nbsp;Exceptionally, a 
holiday 
replacement may be assigned in case you will be unavailable to play for 
a short 
period of time. &nbsp;Please send an e-mail to <A 
href="mailto:admin@shadowlandgames.com">admin@shadowlandgames.com</A>
to indicate this.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">2. Players should not send in orders for 
another 
player's faction, to ruin that person's turn or otherwise benefit.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">3. Players must inform the GM of any game 
bugs 
found. &nbsp;Send an email to <A 
href="mailto:admin@shadowlandgames.com">admin@shadowlandgames.com</A>
or post a bug report on the forum.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">4. Anti-social behavior, including 
harassing 
telephone calls, sending obscene/obnoxious unwanted communications, mail 

bombing, etc. will not be tolerated.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Punishment for serious violations is generally banishment from 
Olympia. So 
don't cheat, do play fair, and be a good sport.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All decisions of the GM are final.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Noble Points</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">A player starts with a certain amount of 
Noble 
Points (NP's). Each player gets an additional NP at fixed turns that are 
a 
multiple of eight (so at turns 8, 16, 24, 32, etc...). Players who join 
the game 
late, get additional starting NP's, known as Catch-up NP's. 
&nbsp;Ideally, all 
players will have an equal number of NP's at their disposal at any time. 

&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">NP's are used to buy nobles with the FORM

<div class="details">
<P>Orders for Olympia game 4 should be sent to <A 
href="mailto:olympia@shadowlandgames.com">olympia@shadowlandgames.com</A>.</P>
<P>The 'Reply-To:' header on turn reports is set to this e-mail address, 
so 
using the reply feature of your e-mail client should send orders to the 
right 
place.</P>
<P>Your orders are automatically loaded into the game
and queued for your units. The scanner will send a reply as soon as it
processes your mail, showing whether or not there were any errors 
with the 
orders it received.</P>
<P>Note that the order scanner does not do an exhaustive check of your
orders' syntax; it checks that the commands given exist, and checks the
parameters of those commands that are executed at parse time - notably
those involved in parsing (begin, unit, password, email and vis_email),
in report formatting (format and notab)
and those which have immediate secondary effects (resend and lore).
Other commands' parameters are only checked when they are executed
during the turn run.
</P>
<P>Orders must be of the following form:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">begin player-number password</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">email, lore, password commands</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit player-number</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">commands for player entity: name, format 
or 
quit</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit unit-number</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">commands for unit</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit unit-number</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">commands for unit</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">end</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>The `Subject:' line on your message is ignored.</P>
<P>The begin keyword tells the order scanner what your player number is. 
If you 
have not set a password, you do not need to supply one.</P>
<P>The unit command replaces a set of orders for a unit. Any pending 
orders for 
the unit will be cleared, and the new orders sent in will queue up. 
Orders that 
are still executing for the unit will not be interrupted unless the 
first order 
queued is the stop order.</P>
<P>Do not match an end for every unit command! There should only be one 
end, at 
the end of all of the unit sections. The Olympia order parser will not 
read 
beyond the end.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For example, here is a set of orders for player Fate [812], who has 
two 
characters, Osswid [5499] and Candide [1269]:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">begin 812</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">password&nbsp;sneaky</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit 5499</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">explore</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">move east</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">explore</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">study 600</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit 1269</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">move north</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">stack 5499</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">end</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>The parser tries to be as flexible as possible. It is case 
insensitive and is 
not strict about spaces on a line, so you may use indentation to make 
your 
orders more readable.</P>
<P>Orders may be commented with the `#' character. Everything from a `#' 
to the 
end of the line will be ignored by the parser:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">move north # Head to Drassa to meet up 
with 
Osswid</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">stack 5499 # stack with him</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>No one will read the comments but you. Neither the GM nor the Olympia 
engine 
will try to interpret them for any reason.</P>
<P>Note that arguments must be enclosed in quotes if they are more than 
one 
word:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">name "Osswid the Constructor"</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>The acknowledgement will show any errors that occurred while the 
orders were 
being parsed, and list the current pending commands for all of your 
units.</P>
<P>There is a limit of 250 orders which may be queued per unit. 
Additional 
orders will be dropped and will not appear in the unit's command 
queue.</P>
</div>
</li>

<li id="interrupt_orders">
<a href="#interrupt_orders">Interrupting orders</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Suppose the turn report shows the following orders queued:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit 5499</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px"># &gt; study 160 (executing for three 
more 
days)</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">recruit 10</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">explore</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sending in new orders for this unit will not disturb the 
still-running study 
command unless the first order is stop.</P>
<P>For example: If this were sent in:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit 5499</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">move south</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>This would be the result:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit 5499</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px"># &gt; study 160 (executing for three 
more 
days)</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">move south</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To interrupt the study and get on with the move right away, instead 
send 
in:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit 5499</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">stop</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">move south</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This will show:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">unit 5499</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px"># &gt; study 160 (executing for three

days)</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">stop</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">move south</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Note that the stop queues like any other order; it does not actually 
interrupt the executing command until the turn runs. This means that the 
stop 
itself can be replaced by sending in another set of orders later.</P>

<li id="new_units">

<div class="details">
<P>Orders may be sent in for units which are not yet under control, such

<P>As soon as the unit comes under your control, the orders queued for

<P>Orders may also be sent in for new nobles which will be formed during

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">form 5628 "Feasel the Wicked"</P>

<P>Then queue some orders for Feasel to execute as soon as he

<P>Note that the layout of the order template matches the syntax the 
order 
scanner expects. Many players find it convenient to edit this template 
to add or 
change commands for their units. Mail everything from the begin to end 
(inclusive) to the order scanner. &nbsp;It is wise to save a copy of the 
orders 
you submit in case there are errors and they need to be resent.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<HR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Be careful </STRONG></P>
<P>Beware of sending in different sets of orders too quickly. Sometimes 
messages 
sent within a short time of each other will arrive out of order. This 
can wreak 
havoc on your turn if the wrong orders arrive last. Compose your orders 
offline 
and review them before mailing. A simple typographical error in your 
orders 
could ruin your whole turn!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Some players make clever use of the PASSWORD order to make sure that 
an order 
set lingering out in the email system on the network which arrives late 
won't 
replace a more recent order set sent in. For example, say you submit 
some orders 
on Friday, and they don't show up by Monday. Monday you send an updated 
set of 
orders to order scanner and get an instant reply. The Friday orders have 
not 
arrived yet, but you're worried that they're out there and will arrive 
sooner or 
later, replacing the newer set of orders you just sent in. Solution: 
issue a 
PASSWORD order in the newer set, so the Friday orders will fail when 
they do 
arrive.</P>

<li id="failed_orders">
<a href="#failed_orders">Failed orders</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Commands that fail generally take zero time.</P>
<P>For instance, if study is issued for a skill which the location does 
not 
offer, it will fail immediately, and take zero time. The failed study 
order will 
not take a week, and it will not count toward the limited study time for 
that 
month.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Production commands fail immediately if none of their input resources 
are 
available. For instance, recruit in a location with no peasants will 
immediately 
fail, taking zero time. However, resources may sometimes become depleted 
while 
the command is being executed. In such cases, the command may fail even 
after it 
has spent some time executing.&nbsp;</P>

<a href="#player_entity">Player Entity</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Each Olympia player faction has a number. This number is represented 
by an 
entity in the game. However, unlike a character, this entity is mostly 
used as a 
place holder for the faction. No one can see the faction entity, and it 
can 
issue very few orders.</P>
<P>For example, suppose player Fate [501] has one character Osswid 
[5499]. Fate 
does not exist in any location, so it does not receive a location 
report, and no 
one can see it. However, Osswid, being the player character for the 
faction, is 
sworn to Fate [501]. Fate may execute only a limited set of 
administrative 
orders.</P>
<P>Characters, not factions, issue most orders. Do not try to form or 
recruit 
with the player entity. For most turns, the player entity will have no 
orders 
queued for it.</P>
<P>The orders a player entity may issue are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>accept</LI>
  <LI>admit</LI>
  <LI>default</LI>
  <LI>defend</LI>
  <LI>format</LI>

<li id="quitting">
<a href="#quitting">Quitting</a>
<div class="details">
<P>To drop out of the game, issue the quit order for your player 
entity.</P>
<P>For instance, player 501 would quit by sending in the following 
orders:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">begin 812 password</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">unit 812 # don't forget unit for the

<a href="#character_order">Order of characters in a location</a>
<div class="details">
<P>When a character enters a location, it is added to the end of the 
list of 
characters already there. The unit that has been in a location the 
longest will 
appear at the top of the list.</P>
<P>If a character leaves a location and later returns, it will be put at 
the end 
of the list again.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Seen here:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">Candide [1269]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">Osswid [5499]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">Feasel the Wicked [1109]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Candide has been here longest, followed by Osswid, then Feasel. If 
Candide 
were to leave and return, he would appear at the end of the list.</P>
<P>If a character unstacks from beneath another unit, the character will 
appear 
just after the unit, rather than at the end of the list.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Seen here:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">Candide [1269], accompanied by:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 120px">Osswid [5499]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 120px">Feasel the Wicked [1109]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Osswid is stacked beneath Candide. If Osswid unstacks, he will appear 
after 
Candide, not after Feasel:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Seen here:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">Candide [1269]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">Osswid [5499]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">Feasel the Wicked [1109]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Note: new player characters are added to the top of the 
list of characters in the safe haven in which they join, not the bottom. 
Additonal characters formed by them will appear at the bottom of the 
list as 
usual.</P>

<li id="command_priority">
<a href="#command_priority">Command priority</a>
<div class="details">
<P>All orders have a priority of 0-4.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Permission commands (admit, hostile, etc.) are priority 0.</LI>
  <LI>Zero-time commands and wait are priority 1.</LI>
  <LI>move and fly are priority 2.</LI>
  <LI>The sail command is priority 4.</LI>
  <LI>All other commands are priority 3.</LI></UL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The order scheduler will first try to start all priority 0 orders. 
Only when 
no more priority 0 orders are ready to start will a priority 1 order be 
started.</P>
<P>In other words, the order scheduler will not start an order at a 
higher 
priority when an order may be started at a lower priority.</P>
<P>Orders at the same priority are resolved in location order. If two 
units in a 
location are both waiting to start a move order, the first unit in the 
location 
will go first.</P>
<P>The above description of order priorities may seem complicated, but 
the 
intent is to let players ignore same-day synchronization issues in most 
cases. 
Rather that needing wait to guarantee that give happens before move, the 
lower 
priority of give makes this happen naturally.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For example, consider three units stacked together, top, mid and 
bot:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">top:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">move ec69</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">yew</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">mid:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">unstack</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">recruit</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">bot:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">recruit</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>These should be executed in the following order:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">mid:&nbsp;unstack # unstack is prio-1</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">top: move ec69 # move is prio-2</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">mid: recruit # recruit is prio-3 [top and 
bot 
arrive at ec69]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">top: yew # yew is prio-3</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">bot: recruit # recruit is prio-3</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>The unstack happened first since it's a priority 1 command. The move 
went 
second. When top and bot finished moving, there were only priority three 

commands left, so they ran in location order.</P>

<P>Order precedence within a location is an advantage for commands or

they were started on the same day.</P>

<P>Olympia's map is a large grid of locations called provinces. Groups 
of 
provinces form continents, islands and oceans. These collections are 
called 
regions, and are usually named.</P>
<P>A province's description will include a list of the directions in 
which a 
character may travel:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Plain [ae48], plain, in region Tollus</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 80px">Routes leaving Plain [ae48]:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 120px">North, to Plain [ad48], 7 days</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 120px">East, to Plain [ae49], 7 days</P>

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 120px">West, to Ocean [ae47], Tymaerian Sea, 1 
day</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 120px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>This is a non-descript province in the Tollus region.</P>
<P>From this province, a character may travel north or east on foot or 
by horse, 
or may sail by ship to the south or west.</P>
<P>move north -or- move n -or- move ad48</P>
<P>move east -or- move e -or- move ae49</P>
<P>sail south -or- sail e -or- sail af48</P>
<P>sail west -or- sail w -or- sail ae47</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Land movement will automatically use the fastest available mode. For 
example, 
if a character has enough horses for all of the members in the party to 
ride, 
then the travelers will go on horseback.</P>
<P>Ocean movement requires that the character be in a ship.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Route distances are rated for the number of days it normally takes to 

traverse them. Land distances are rated for a lightly loaded character 
walking, 
and ocean distances are given for an ordinary ship traveling in normal 
weather.</P>
<P>Actual travel times may differ from times given in the route listing. 
Land 
distances depend on the surrounding terrain and the modes of transport 
available. For example, horses often speed up movement, but over 
especially 
rough or treacherous terrain, they may actually slow travel because they 
must be 
led and managed. A stiff wind may speed ocean vessels, while lack of 
wind may 
slow their progress.</P>

<div class="details">
<P>Players should take care when exploring the Olympian world. There are 
many 
dangers, both from non-player characters (NPC's) as well as from other 
players. 
While the threat of death to nobles is always present, the following 
dangerous 
areas warrant extra caution.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Hades</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Hades, also known as The Land of the 
Dead, is a 
subterranean world populated with demons, ghouls and spirits thirsty for 
the 
blood of the living. Only the bravest warriors should consider walking 
these 
dark paths.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Faery</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">The Faery world lies in a nearby, but 
separate 
reality. Occasionally a Faery hill will exist simultaneously in both 
Faery and 
the outside world. During this time, mortals may cross between the two 
worlds. 
Faery is protected by the Faery Hunt, a tough band of elves armed with 
magical 
bows. Each hunt group consists of 10-50 elves, each with a combat rating 
of 
(50,50,100). Rumors speak of a magical talisman, the elfstone, which 
allows 
mortals to pass unharmed in Faery, and to summon Faery hills to the 
mortal 
world.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The Cloudlands</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">The Cloudlands is a small region which 
floats over 
Mt. Olympus and the Imperial City. It is generally only accessible by 
flight. 
The Cloudlands is home to three cities: Nimbus, Stratos and Aerovia. 
Weather 
magic is taught in these three cities.</P>

<li id="health">
<a href="#health">Health</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Nobles have a health rating of 1-100, which indicates how wounded 
they are. A 
noble with health 100 has no wounds; a noble with a health of zero dies. 
Nobles 
also have a flag which indicates whether they are suffering from an 
illness. A 
sick noble will lose some health each week, while a wounded noble who is 

otherwise free of illness will recover somewhat each week.</P>
<P>Health is shown in the turn report for each noble that the player 
controls.</P>
<P>This is a noble in perfect health:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Health: 100%</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>This is a rather sick noble:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Health: 38% (getting worse)</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>If the noble were cured of illness, this would instead show:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Health: 38% (getting better)</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Medical technology is rather crude in the age of Olympia. Sanitation 
and 
hygiene are not the best. Even a minor wound runs a risk of developing 
into a 
serious, possibly life-threatening problem.</P>
<P>When a noble receives a new injury, their health is reduced by the 
amount of 
the injury, and a check is made to see whether they get sick. The chance 
that a 
character falls ill is (100 - health). Thus, the more seriously the 
noble is 
wounded, the greater the probability that infection will set in.</P>
<P>Health is updated at the end of each game week (on days 7, 14, 21 and 
28). 
Sick nobles lose 3-15 health each week. Healthy but wounded nobles 
recover by a 
like amount. Each week sick nobles have a 5% chance of fighting off 
their 
illness.</P>
<P>Nobles located in an inn benefit from the rest and relaxation that 
the inn 
provides. Inns increase the chance of fighting off infection to 10% each 

week.</P>
<P>Illness can also be cured by spells, special skills, or magical 
potions. Sick 
nobles would be wise to seek out those practiced in healing, and recover 
in a 
nearby inn.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Notes:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Characters who recover from illness will not suddenly become sick 
again. 
  The illness check is only made when a new wound is received.</LI>
  <LI>Since the chance that a character becomes sick is based on the 
unit's 
  health after deducting a hit, an already-wounded noble stands a 
greater chance 
  of becoming ill from a wound than a healthy one.</LI>
  <LI>Health is only tracked for nobles. Peasants, workers, sailors, 
soldiers, 
  etc. are either dead or alive; they have no health rating.</LI>
  <LI>A wound received in combat will be randomly chosen between 1 and 
100. 
  Wounds received in other activities are scaled to match the level of 
danger 
  involved.</LI>
  <LI>Some NPCs are not rated for health. Health for these characters 
appears as 
  n/a in the turn report. For means of directly inflicting damage 
against a 
  character such as terrorize, Aura blasts, and Lightning bolts, such a 
unit 
  requires a hit of 50 or more points in order to be killed.</LI></UL>

<li id="death">
<a href="#death">Death</a>
<div class="details">
<P>When a noble is killed in battle or dies, the body is moved into the 
province 
as an item which may be found with EXPLORE. An executed noble's body is 
given to 
the character who performed the execution.</P>
<P>A dead body exists for one and one half game years, at which point it 
fully 
decomposes, and the dead noble's spirit passes on.</P>
<P>Example: A dead body rots after twelve months have passed, so if a 
noble dies 
in turn 20, his body will decompose at the end of turn 32.</P>
<P>The bodies of nobles lost at sea will wash ashore somewhere.</P>
<P>Bodies decompose after one and one half years regardless of whether 
they 
remain in the province or are possesions of another.</P>
<P>Priests may learn a skill Lay to rest, hastening the passing of the 
dead 
noble's spirit. Some exceptionally skilled priests possess the ability 
to 
resurrect dead characters.</P>
<P>In general, NP's invested in characters are returned to the 
character's 
player if the character deserts or his body decomposes.</P>
<P>Characters which renounce service becaused of lapsed contract or fear 
loyalty 
do not immediately return the NPs to the previous owner. The previous 
owner of 
these characters will not receive NPs for them until they swear to a new 
player 
faction or die.</P>
<P>When a body decomposes, the number of NP's which were invested in the 

character are returned to the original owner.</P>

<li id="markets">

<div class="details">
<P>Characters issue buy and sell commands to indicate their desire to 
trade 
goods. Every trade must be between a buyer and a seller. Whenever a 
compatible 
buy and sell request are found, the trade will be executed.</P>
<P>Trades are only matched in cities, where merchants gather at the 
local bazaar 
to swap goods. (Note that characters are always free to use the give 
command to 
exchange items, regardless of where they are. But buy and sell orders 
are only 
matched in cities.)</P>
<P>A buyer indicates what he wants to buy, how much of it he wants, and 
the most 
he is willing to pay. A seller indicates what item is being sold, how 
much of it 
is to be sold, and the per-item price.</P>
<P>A trade will match if the seller's price does not exceed the maximum 
price 
specified by the buyer; if the buyer has enough gold to buy at least one 
of the 
item; if the seller possesses at least one of the item; and if the buyer 
and 
seller are both in the same city.</P>
<P>If the buyer is willing to pay more than the seller is asking, the 
trade 
takes place at the seller's price.</P>
<P>Example: A noble who wants to buy five iron [79] at no more than 10 
gold each 
issues:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&gt; buy 79 5 10</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Try to buy five iron [79] for 10 gold 
each.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>If someone who had iron issues a sell order which matches this 
buyer's 
request, the trade would be executed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&gt; sell 79 5 10</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Sold five iron [79] for 50 gold.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>The buyer would see:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Bought five iron [79] for 50 gold.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Either the buy or the sell order could have been issued first. If the 
order 
can't be matched with pending trades from other units in the city, it 
will 
become a standing order and remain in effect until executed or 
canceled.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&gt; buy 79 0</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Cleared pending buy for iron [79].</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>

<P>A trade will not be listed unless it could be executed. For instance, 
a unit 
might issue an order to sell iron [79], even though the unit doesn't 
possess 
any. (Perhaps the character plans to get some iron later in the month, 
and wants 
the buy order to be in place when the iron arrives). This order will not 
be 
shown in the market report, because the seller doesn't have any iron to 
sell.</P>
<P>Similarly, the buyer must have enough gold to buy at least one of the 
item. 
No buy order would be listed for a penniless unit that wanted to buy 
five iron 
at 10 gold each. If the unit later obtained 10 gold, enough to buy one 
of the 
five desired units of iron, the order would be listed in the market

one iron, not five.</P>

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Try to sell five iron [79] for 6 gold

<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>The trade will not take place, because the seller's price exceeds the 

buyer's. Later, the buyer travels to a different city, where another

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&gt; sell 79 10 4</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Try to sell ten iron [79] for 4 gold

<P>As soon as the buyer enters the city, the trade will be matched:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Bought three iron [79] for 12 gold.</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Note that the trade takes place at the seller's price, and that the 
seller 
will still be offering seven iron at four gold each.</P>
<P>If the seller had only one unit of iron for sale, the trade would 
have 
executed, but the buyer would still be looking for two more iron to buy,

<a href="#loyalty">Loyalty Bonds</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Nobles are bound to their lords by one of three kinds of loyalty:</P>
<DL>
  <DT><EM>contract</EM></DT>
  <DD>The noble is being paid for his service</DD>
  <DD>&nbsp;</DD>
  <DT><EM>oath</EM></DT>

  <DT><EM>fear</EM></DT>
  <DT style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">The noble serves out of fear</DT>
  <DT style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">&nbsp;</DT></DL>
<P>The loyalty bond is rated. For example, a character's loyalty could 
be 
oath-1, contract-500, or fear-50.</P>
<P>A player's initial character has oath-2 loyalty.</P>
<P>Newly hired nobles have loyalty contract-500. Nobles are paid for 
their 
service with the <CODE>honor</CODE> command. A noble who issues 
`<CODE><CODE>honor</CODE> 50</CODE>' will spend 50 gold to raise his own 

contract loyalty rating by 50 points.</P>
<P>A noble may take an oath of loyalty, pledging one or two Noble Points 
to 
secure it. This would yield loyalty oath-1 or oath-2. The 
<CODE>oath</CODE> 
order secures an oath of loyalty for a noble.</P>
<P>Nobles may be terrorized by their masters. The severity of their 
treatment 
accumulates in the loyalty rating: fear-10, for instance. Fear loyalty 
is 
maintained with the <CODE>terrorize</CODE> order.</P>
<P>Only one kind of loyalty may be active at a time.</P>
<P>Contract and fear loyalty decay over time. Contract loyalty loses the 
greater 
of 50 points or 10% of the current rating each month. Fear loyalty loses 
1-2 
rating points each month. Oath loyalty does not decay.</P>
<P>Units which fall to contract-0 or fear-0 have a 50% chance of 
deserting each 
month.</P>
<P>Nobles serving through contract or fear are susceptible to bribes, 
which may 
induce them to renounce loyalty to their lord, and pledge their service 
to the 
bribing faction. For details on bribing characters, see the 
<CODE>bribe</CODE> 
order.</P>
<P>Oath-1 nobles ignore all bribes. There is a persuasion skill which 
may cause 
an oath-1 noble to defect, although its use is difficult and rarely 
succeeds. 
Oath-1 nobles may reveal their factional affiliation if tortured.</P>
<P>Oath-2 nobles will not renounce loyalty to their lord under any 
circumstances, nor can they be forced to reveal any information about 
themselves.</P>

<li id="stacking">

<div class="details">
<P>One unit may <CODE>stack</CODE> under another unit. Two or more units 
grouped 
in this way are referred to as a <EM>stack</EM>.</P>
<P>Stacks move together and fight together. Here is a stack of four 
units:</P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE>Law Netexus [2020], accompanied by:
  Feasel the Wicked [1109]
  Drakkar the Trader [1752]
  Alion Krysaka [2785]
</PRE></DD>
  <DT>&nbsp;</DT></DL>
<P>Law Netexus is the stack leader, the top-most unit in the stack.</P>
<P>Only one level of stack depth is shown, so all that can be determined 
from 
the location report is that Feasel, Drakkar and Alion are stacked 
somewhere 
beneath Law Netexus. The exact arrangement of stacking bonds is not 
shown.</P>
<P>Feasel might be stacked under Law Netexus, with Drakkar and Alion 
under 
Feasel. Or Feasel, Drakkar, and Alion may all be stacked directly 
beneath Law 
Netexus.</P>
<P>Generally, such internal arrangements are only important when the 
stack 
breaks up. If Drakkar is stacked beneath Feasel, he will stick with 
Feasel if 
Feasel drops out of the stack. But if Drakkar were stacked beneath Law 
Netexus, 
he would not follow Feasel if Feasel unstacked.</P>
<P>If Law Netexus issues a <CODE>move</CODE> order, the entire stack 
will move. 
If, however, Feasel issues a <CODE>move</CODE> order, he will first drop 
out of 
the stack before moving.</P>
<P>Similarly, if Law Netexus engages combat with the <CODE>attack</CODE> 
order, 
all characters in the stack will fight together. If one member of the 
stack is 
attacked, the entire stack will respond in defense.</P>
<P>Multiple levels of internal stacking can be useful if one wants 
several 
stacks to join together for a while, but then split apart later into 
their old 
arrangements.</P>
<P>Ocean ships may not be stacked together. There is no way to cluster 
ships 
into a fleet.</P>

<P>`<CODE>man</CODE>' includes all of the varieties of men, including 
peasants, 
sailors, workers, etc. as well as nobles. A knight includes both the man

<P>In order to ride, the total riding capacity must cover the weights of

  <P>The ox may be driven alongside the horse, but will not carry

  <DT><EM>man + riding horse + ox</EM></DT></DL>
<P>A stack will ride if there is enough riding capacity to carry all of 
the 
non-riders. Otherwise, the stack will walk.</P>
<P>In order to fly, the total flying capacity for the stack must cover 
the 
weights of all units that can not fly themselves.</P>
<P>Stacks which are overloaded beyond their walking capacity will travel 
slower 
than normal. A stack loaded at 150% of its walking capacity will take 
50% longer 
to traverse a route. Stacks overloaded to over 200% of walking capacity 
may not 
travel at all.</P>
<P>Weights and capacities are always considered for the stack as a 
whole. One 
unit may have all the men, and another unit may have all the horses. If 
they are 
stacked together, the distribution of items across units is 
irrelevant.</P>

<P>Some men may only be trained in certain kinds of locations. Elite 
guard and 
elite archers, for instance, may only be trained in castles. Blessed 
soldiers 
may only be trained in temples.</P>
<P>Training takes one day per man. Training five archers into five elite 
archers 
would take five days, for example. Training ten peasants into ten

<P>Research attempts to discover sub-skills which are not commonly known 
or made 
available when the category skill is learned.</P>
<P>Research is mostly used to discover new magical spells, as few spells 
are 
granted when a magic school is learned. However, even common skills such 
as 
Shipcraft, Combat and Construction may have hidden sub-skills which can 
be found 
through research.</P>
<P>Research for all skill categories except Religion [750] must be 
performed in 
a tower, by the tower's owner (the first character inside the tower). 
Towers 
make good laboratories for scholarly investigations, and minimize 
distractions. 
Other occupants of the tower may not use <CODE>research</CODE>.</P>
<P>Research into Religion [750] must be performed in a temple, by the 
temple's 
owner.</P>
<P>Research by mages of 6th black circle level and above (maximum aura 
of 31 or 
higher) must be done in provinces with a civilization level of 1 or 
less.</P>
<P>When a category skill is learned, its lore sheet appears in the

   ...

Further skills may be found through research.
</PRE></DD>
  <DT>&nbsp;</DT></DL>
<P>The last line (`<CODE>Further skills ...</CODE>') indicates that 
there are 
sub-skills of Shipcraft which are not mentioned in the lore sheet. These 
hidden 
skills may represent rare or hard-to-learn knowledge, or perhaps 
technology 
which has not yet been discovered.</P>
<P>Study of these skills is not possible based simply on knowledge of 
the parent 
skill. Sailing [601] can be learned by a character, no matter where he 
is, once 
Shipcraft is known. Hidden Shipcraft skills, however, must be learned in 
other 
ways, even if the character has learned their entity numbers from other 
players.</P>
<P>There are two possible ways such hidden skills may be learned:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Through a rare book or scroll which offers instruction in the 
skill.</LI>
  <LI>Through research.</LI></OL>
<P>Research is the more difficult choice. However, to learn rare 
sub-skills 
there may be no alternative. Perhaps there are no players who already 
know the 
rare sub-skill, and so cannot record scrolls to instruct others. Or if 
there 
are, they choose to keep their knowledge secret.</P>
<P>Research incurs a fee of 25 gold to pay for miscellaneous materials 
and 
costs.</P>
<P>Each week of research yields a 25% chance that a new skill will be 
discovered.</P>
<P>If research is successful, the new sub-skill will be added to the 
character's 
partially known skill list. It then must be studied in order to become 
fully 
known and usable.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<DL>
  <DD><PRE>1: &gt; research 600
1: Will research Shipcraft for seven days.
7: Research uncovers a new skill:  Improve ship rigging [9999].
7: To begin learning this skill, order 'study 9999'.

</PRE></DD>
  <DT>&nbsp;</DT></DL>
<P>The `<CODE>0/7</CODE>' qualifying the new sub-skill in the partially

the

<P>Aura is a mystical force necessary to cast spells. Powerful mages

<P>Characters are rated for their current aura level and their maximum 
aura 
level. With each magical spell learned, a character will gain one point 
of 
maximum and current aura. Current aura is depleted by casting spells,

naturally replenished at a rate of two points per turn. Current aura 
will 
increase until it reaches the maximum aura level. Other ways of gaining 
current 
aura may be found as the mage researches his craft.</P>

prisoners.&nbsp;</P>
<DIV>Each week (four times each game turn), a prisoner being held by a

<DIV>Each time a prisoner is transferred with the give order, there is a

travel 
which takes longer than one day, there is a 2% chance that the prisoner 
will be 
able to get free. Thus, short movement, such as entering or exiting a 
building, 
will not give the prisoners additional opportunities for escape, but 
traveling 
between provinces with prisoners will.</DIV>

<P>If 4205 or 4600 run into unit 6499, they will attack it on sight.

<P>If 6499 is attacked and both 6530 and 6599 are present, 6599 will aid

<P>If player 816 wanted 6530 to defend the faction's units anyway, 
either 816 or 
6530 should issue the order `<CODE><CODE>defend</CODE> 816</CODE>'. This

<P>Attitude toward units is considered before attitude toward the unit's 

faction. Thus, one may declare a faction hostile, but exclude certain 
units 
within the faction by specifically declaring them neutral.</P>
<P>A unit must be the top-most character in its stack to aid in defense.

unit joins a combat because of <CODE>defend</CODE>, it will bring its

<li id="castles">
<a href="#castles">Castles</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Castles are the foundation of land ownership. A castle provides its 
owner 
with taxes from the province it is located in, as well as from garrisons 
in 
other provinces which are bound to the castle.</P>
<P>The owner of a castle automatically receives half of the remaining 
tax base 
from the castle's province at the end of each month. If a garrison is 
stationed 
in the same province as a castle, the garrison will first pay 
maintenance from 
the province's tax base, then the castle will collect half of whatever 
is 
left.</P>
<P>Each province may contain only one castle. The castle must be built 
in the 
outer province or in a city, if the province has one. (Tax revenue for 
the 
castle is the same no matter where it is built.) Castles may not be 
built inside 
other sublocations.</P>
<P>A castle alone is not sufficient to rule a province. A garrison must 
be 
stationed outside the castle in the province to protect it.</P>
</div>
</li>

<li id="garrisons">
<a href="#garrisons">Garrisons</a>
<div class="details">
<P>Garrisons are groups of men who are stationed in provinces to protect 
them, 
and collect taxes in the name of a castle. Garrisons must be created 
with the 
<CODE>garrison</CODE> order, and must be bound to a castle located in 
the same 
region.</P>
<P>For example, suppose that the region Lesser Atnos had 20 provinces. 
One of 
these provinces contains Amber Keep [0909]. A garrison bound to Amber 
Keep could 
be stationed in each of the 20 provinces (including the province 
containing the 
castle itself).</P>
<P>Continuing the example, garrison units not in the Lesser Atnos region 
could 
not be bound to Amber Keep. The castle a garrison is bound to must be in 
the 
same region.</P>
<P>Garrisons can be bound to any castle in the region. If Lesser Atnos 
had two 
castles, some of the garrisons could be bound to one, and the rest to 
the second 
castle.</P>
</div>
</li>

<li id="more_garrisons">
<a href="#more_garrisons">More about garrisons</a>
<div class="details">
<P>A garrison in a province containing a castle must be bound to that 
castle.</P>
<P>A garrison may only be installed in a province adjoining a province 
which 
already contains a garrison bound to the same castle, or the province 
the castle 
is in.</P>
<P>Garrisons are established with the `<CODE><CODE>garrison</CODE> 
<VAR>castle</VAR></CODE>' order. Ten soldiers are required to create a 
garrison. 
The <CODE>garrison</CODE> order must be issue at the outer level of a 
province; 
one can't establish a garrison while inside a city, building or other 
sublocation.</P>
<P>The garrison pays the maintenance cost of its men directly from the 
tax base 
of the province. Half of the remaining tax base is forwarded to the 
castle the 
garrison is bound to.</P>
<P>For example, a garrison of ten soldiers would require 20 gold per 
month to 
support. This would leave 280 gold remaining in a typical province. 50% 
of this, 
or 140 gold, would be forwarded to the owner of the garrison's 
castle.</P>

<P>Garrisons do not provide full location reports to their owners. They 
do 
notice any resource depletion activity, such as timber cutting or 
mining, as

includes 
any stack of five units or more, any party of 20 or more men, and most

<P>Garrisons do not monitor activity in hidden locations, even if the

<P>The `<CODE><CODE>decree watch</CODE> <VAR>who</VAR></CODE>' order may

<li id="pledging">
<a href="#pledging">Pledging land</a>
<div class="details">
<P>A noble may <CODE>pledge</CODE> his lands to another noble. This 
grants the 
pledge target status by increasing the number provinces he may rule 
over.</P>
<P>For example, suppose there are two castle owners, Osswid and Feasel. 
Osswid 
has garrisoned six provinces, and Feasel has three. Osswid is therefore 
a baron, 
and Feasel is a lord.</P>
<P>If Feasel and Osswid both pledge to Candide, Candide would attain the

Count. Osswid and Feasel would remain at the same rank in this

<P>Candide would receive garrison reports for all provinces which Osswid

Feasel control. He would have the same privileges in the controlled

he could take items from the garrisons, alter the names of the provinces

  <LI>Imperial Throne [401] 
  <P>Long ago, the emperor of Olympia sat on his throne in the emperor's 
palace, 
  high amidst Mt. Olympus. It is said that whoever rebuilds the famed 
castle on 
  Mt. Olympus, and sits upon the throne, will be titled Emperor of 
Olympia.</P>

  <LI>Crown of Prosperity [402] 
  <P>The Crown of Prosperity was once worn by the most prosperous mortal 
to ever 
  rule in Olympia, King Damar. Damar now wears his crown in the 
underworld and 
  reflects on his past adventures of long ago, before the first Great 
Ending 
  swept away all that he knew, and carried him from his beloved city of 
Kircarth 
  to the land of the dead.</P>
  <P>Sometimes nobles are able to acquire the Crown and hold it for a 
time. The 
  crown infuses whatever province it ends each turn in with a measure of 

  prosperity and economic health, equivalent to a +2 increase in the 
province's 
  civilization level.</P>
  <P>However, this prosperity does not last forever, for King Damar's 
ghostly 
  hand invariably will reach out from the underworld to reclaim his 
relic. The 
  Crown can be expected to return to its rightful owner 12-24 turns 
after its 
  appearance in the mortal world.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P></LI>
  <LI>Skull of Bastrestric [403] 
  <P>The most feared of the ancients was a wizard of terrible power 
known as 
  Bastrestric ther Archymonaged. Bastrestric routinely incinerated his 
foes (or 
  anyone who offended him) with bursts of raw aura energy directed from 
his 
  black tower in the castle built on Mt. Olympus.</P>
  <P>Though he was the most powerful living mage in the known world, and 
by any 
  measure a fearsome, unholy force, Bastrestric yearned for ever greater 

  abilities. He felt increasingly constrained by the limits of his 
mortal body, 
  and thus in time resolved to abandon it. BtA's spirit jumped free of 
his body, 
  plunging directly into the aura rivers which bind together the deepest 

  structures of the very world itself. Only a scorched, empty body was 
left 
  behind in his tower.</P>
  <P>BtA's spirit has passed on, but the remants of his mortal body 
continue to 
  radiate intense power.</P>
  <P>Use of BtA's skull (USE 403) causes an intense aura burst which a 
mage will 
  attempt to absorb. If successful, the mage will gain a 50-75 boost to 
current 
  aura (within the limit of 5 times the mage's maximum aura).</P>
  <P>There is a 25% chance that the mage will be killed by use of the 
skull. 
  Non-mages who use the skull will be instantly killed.</P>
  <P>BtA's skull will vanish with use, or within 10-20 turns after 
appearing in 
  the mortal world.</P>
