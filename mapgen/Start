Starting Cities
---------------

Players may choose one of five starting cities.  Each of the cities
is located on the continent of Provinia, the largest land mass on
the main Olympia G2 map.  Four of the cities (Drassa, Rimmon, Harn,
and Aurnos) are ports; the fifth city (the old Imperial City) is
located roughly in the center of the continent, adjacent to Mount
Olympus.

The five cities have similar terrain resources nearby.
